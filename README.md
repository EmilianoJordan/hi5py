# hi5py

An implementation of the h5py library for common Python data structures.

# Why hi5py?

I've been working in dynamics for the last few years and in developing software
for mechanical engineers I've realized there are several pain points.
One of those in Python when compared to Matlab  is the inability to easily save out
whatever data structure you want to a file. This library is a utility that is meant
to save out common data structures including numpy arrays reliably. The goal is to
eventually add Pandas objects as well, and xarray is being contemplated.

If none of these objects are what you're working in, feature requests are always
welcome, or you can take advantage of an extremely extensible design.
